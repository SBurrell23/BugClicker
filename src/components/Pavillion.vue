        Welcome to the Buttterfly Pavillion!

        spend nectar to attract butterflies (main cost) (takes time (attraction rate?))
        must spend x resources/sec to maintain butterfly population or butterfly population will drop
        leaves, water, mud

        more butterflies gives increased change to spawn rare butteflies which grant special bonuses like increased production, faster hatching, etc
