Make factories able to PRODUCE multiple resource e.g. turn these into arrays:
"rate" : 0,
"rateIncrement": 1,
"produces": "bugs"

Make factories able to COST multiple resources e.g. turn these into arrays:
"cost": 10,
"costIncrement": 5,
"costType": "bugs",

added geometric progression to factories to mimic cookie clicker rates

Add unlock function loop that unlocks factories at their appropriate time

-----DONE---

get shop working so that you can spend resource to buy 1 time upgrades
upgrades will modify the way a factory works and permenantly effect its stats

adjust shop to refactor upgrades into their own .json File 

save factories and resource to local storage and check and load on startup to save progress
